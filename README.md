# Shokodi â€” A Kodi addon for Shoko

---------------------------------------------------------

As some of you may have discovered, Kodi does not handle anime well. With lots of edits to the naming conventions, elaborate folder structures, and separate metadata files, you can get a very nice result, but how long does that take every time you get a new series? [Shoko](https://shokoanime.com) solves this problem by recognizing files by their data, not by a name or location. Unfortunately, Shoko wasn't made to be viewed in a living room. Kodi has a nice 10-foot interface, and Shoko has a lot of data to show. This is one solution.

## Features

- **Watched States, Resuming, and Scrobbling**\
  Shokodi syncs your watched states, progress, and votes automatically to Shoko. No extra work needs to be done. It has convenient context menu items to mark entire series and groups, as well. Since it is synced to Shoko, you can grab a laptop or tablet and finish watching on-the-go.
- **Filters**\
  Shokodi has full support for displaying Shoko Filters, from Continue Watching to directory style filters like Years, Tags, and Seasons. You can create all kinds of filters in Shoko and choose to show or hide them in clients like Shokodi.
- **Grouping**\
  A less known feature of Shoko is the ability to automatically group related anime together. No more fiddling with [Bakemonogatari](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=rel&aid=6327). We've been there, and we took care of it. Shokodi supports these without any extra effort.
- **Fuzzy Searching**\
  Can you spell Hououin Kyouma without googling it? Well, the rest of us appreciate a search that doesn't insist you commit seppuku when you butcher an innocent foreign name. It's common, so don't worry if you're one of them.

## Thanks

This was initially based on [JAVStream](http://www.ptom.co.uk/home/). The code is far from it at this point, but they still deserve a thanks.\
This was forked from Nakamori, and BigRetroMike put a lot of work into making this a reality. This project diverged due to creative differences, but this still wouldn't exist without his efforts. Thanks BRM!\
A big thanks to the Kodi community for helping with many Kodi related issues over the years.\
An even bigger thanks to the Kodi Team for never giving up, no matter how annoying we all are.\
Also screw those guys. They make our lives so hard sometimes. Pray they never become Plex.

## Installation

There are two ways to install Shokodi.\
The first is to install the [repository](https://da3dsoul.dev/shokodi/repository.shokodi.zip) and let it install and upate everything for you. It also has a modified version of Estuary with a different default layout and some extra perks.\
The other way is to clone this repository using  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/shokoanime/Shokodi`, running build.py with Python, and then manually installing each zip in order of dependency. Generally, you should only use this method if you need to and know what you are doing.

## FAQ

**Q: I can't connect or something?**\
**A:** This **NEEDS** Shoko Server to do anything. The default connection details are 127.0.0.1:8111 (the computer it's running on at port 8111). The default userpass creds are: `Default` with a blank password. Make sure the IP is pointing to the computer that Shoko Server is running on, and that no firewalls or other *fun* is getting in the way.

**Q: My watched states are acting...weird.**\
**A:** That's not a question, but it is weird. This can happen when you use Kodi's built-in Mark as Watched function (pressing W or the button at the bottom of the context menu). There's a button in the Addon Settings, under Browsing at the very bottom, to fix these. If that doesn't help, contact us. It might be a bug.

**Q: Why are the images for things mixed up?**\
**A:** There are a few reasons it could happen. Below the button mentioned right above this, there's a button to clear Kodi's image cache. If that doesn't help, then open Shoko Desktop and see if the TvDB link matches the show. Sometimes the automatic search is wrong. At the least, it's usually funny.

**Q: I keep getting an error about file offset?**\
**A:** This can happen for a few reasons. The most common is that you have a poor connection to the server. The second most common is that your client can't keep up trying to play the file due to crap hardware and/or old software. I have the issue on occasion with my 8-core dev machine with 10GbE to the disk array. Kodi is old and they need more help. If it's a constant issue and/or you just want it gone, then you can disable the resume feature in Addon Settings -> Video.

**Q: What should I do if an error window pops up that wasn't on the list?**\
**A:** If it's just once, and it stops, ignore it. If it keeps happening, tell us. There's an Issue list above, or hop on [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/vpeHDsg) and ask in the #Shokodi or #support channel.

**Q: Something...happened...I don't know?**\
**A:** Yeah, shit happens. Shoko is old. We try, but there are bugs. The first thing we'll tell you is to check if it shows the proper response in Desktop. If it does, then it's probably an issue in the API or Shokodi. Tell us about it, and we can go from there.
